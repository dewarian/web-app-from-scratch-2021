# DEMO üåç
Visit the live version of this prototype on [SpaceX WAFS](https://nb-wafs.vercel.app/).

# DESCRIPTION
Web-App-From-Scratch is a course from the [minor Web Development And Design](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/web-app-from-scratch-2021) where we build a web app with external data but without any frameworks or unnecessary libraries. 

The current concept for this web app 

# INSTALLATION
## Prerequisites
Before you continue with installing this project on your machine make sure your machine has the following;
* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
## Installation

Navigate to a folder where you want to install this application and run the following bash / ZSH command
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/dewarian/web-app-from-scratch-2021.git
```
# USAGE && FEATURES
Run the project with the extension [live-server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or a similar extension if you don't use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
# EXTERNAL DATA
Data is being inserted from an external API called [spaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) and is created by multiple contributors.

The API is an Open Source REST API for multiple categories of data surrounding SpaceX

To get started with using the API you can send a `GET` request to the following endpoint
```http
GET https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/latest

Barring unexpected developments, this mission will be the first crewed flight to launch from the United States since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. DM-2 demonstrates the Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon's ability to safely transport crew to the space station and back to Earth and it is the last major milestone for certification of Crew Dragon. Initially the mission duration was planned to be no longer than two weeks, however NASA has been considering an extension to as much as six weeks or three months. The astronauts have been undergoing additional training for the possible longer mission.",
